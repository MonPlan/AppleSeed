# Getting Started
To get started just fork the [base repository](https://github.com/MonashUnitPlanner/springboot-base-gae-java8)

## Prerequisites
- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Java IDE, we recommend you use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

!> You will need **JDK 1.8** as it is developed for Java 8 on Google Cloud Platform.


## Getting Started

Note: Quickstart guide [here](https://github.com/monplan/AppleSeed/tree/docs-update#quick-start)

1. Start a Project on [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Initialise an app on Google App Engine on Java, choose region and wait for initial setup services to finish
3. [Change pom.xml so that the app meets to the app-id given by GCP.](#configuring-mvn-for-gcp)

!> The **Free** Tier of Google App Engine has certain limits, for more _Google DataStore_ transactions perday, please get a paid tier.

# Developing the Backend

## Upgrade to Version 0.2 Notes
?> In order to speed up development and allow faster fixes we have updated our Framework to have predefined Controllers and Services.

## Configuring MVN for GCP
You will neded to edit `pom.xml`

```xml
    <groupId>springboot-base-gae-java8</groupId>
    <artifactId>${groupId}</artifactId>
    <packaging>war</packaging>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <properties>
        <!-- [START]: CONFIGURATION Your Application Here-->
        <appId>david-app</appId> <!-- CHANGE appID to appID-->
        <environmentID>prod</environmentID>
        <appVersion>1</appVersion>


        <!-- {END] CONFIGURATION-->


        <!-- [DO NOT MODIFY BEGIN]: Auto Configuration -->

        <!-- AUTOMATIC GAE CONFIGURATION -->

        <!--        project ID is automatically set to: 
                            {appId}-{environmentID}
                    so in GCP, the project is named the same
                    for example monplan-frontend-dev
                    is monPlan frontend Environment
                                                                -->
        <projectID>${appId}-${environmentID}</projectID>
        <appVersion>1</appVersion>
        <!-- TO BE CONTINUED -->
    </properties>
```

**appID** needs to be changed to the main appengine project name <br/>
**envrionmentID** is the environment type <br/>

This is designed for an enterprise grade application which follows the convention: 
_appId-environment_ for example, an app called `david-app`, within the `prod` enviromment it will be called `david-app-prod` within the Google Cloud Project.

## Keywords (Glossary)

### Google DataStore Definitions
The following are definitions when building upon Google DataStore

| Concept | Name in _Google DataStore_ | Name in a Relational Database |
|------|------------|--------|
| Category of Object | Kind | Table |
| Entry/One Object | Entity | Row |
| Individual Data for an Object | Property | Field |

## How each class relates to another
<img src="monplan_base_class_diagram.png" >

| Class | Extends | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Model | DataModel  | How the data model is structured also known as the _schema_ |
| Repository | MonPlanRepository | The interface between the service and model, allows for searching to occur |
| Service | MonPlanService | The difference methods that a 'user' can modify the DataStore (database) |
| Controller | MonPlanController | The RESTful API calls (CRUD) that a _web client_ can call |

## Spring annotations used and meaning

Taken from stackoverflow:

| Annotation | Meaning                                             | does |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| @Repository| stereotype for persistence layer                    | Repository are the DAOs (Data Access Objects), they access the database directly. |
| @Service   | stereotype for service layer                        | Service Hold business Logic, Calculations etc. |
| @Controller| stereotype for presentation layer (spring-mvc)      | Controllers just do stuff like dispatching, forwarding, calling service methods etc. |

## Building a Google DataStore Model

Each new **kind** for entity must follow the following model:

For example the creation of a new class called **David** will follow:
```
 |
 \____ controller
          \_____ DavidController.java
 |
 \____ model
          \_____ David.java
 |
 \____ service
          \_____ DavidService.java
 |
 \____ repository
          \_____ DavidRepository.java
```

and within `edu.monash.monplan.config` we have the `ObjectifyConfig` class, we add the following
```
private void registerObjectifyEntities() {
    register(Diesel.class);
    register(DavidHello.class);
+   register(David.class);
}
```

So we can wire this up.

### Making entities: Extending DataModel
```java
package edu.monash.monplan.model;

import com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Entity;
import com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Id;
import com.googlecode.objectify.annotation.Index;
import com.threewks.gaetools.search.SearchIndex;

@Entity
public class David extends DataModel {

    @Id
    private String id;  // A UUID, we assign this ourselves.
    
    @Index
    private String davidCode;  // A code that is assigned by business rules. For example for unit it could be FIT3077.

    @Index
    private String davidName; // A name that is assigned by business rules. For example for a unit it might be Software Engineering Architecture and Design.

    @Index
    private String fullName;

    private List<String> memes;
    
    public String getId(){
        return id;
    }
    
    public String setId(String id){
        this.id = id;
    }
    
    public String getFullName() {
        return fullName;
    }

    public void setFullName(String fullName) {
        this.fullName = fullName;
    }

    public List<String> getMemes() {
        return memes;
    }

    public void setMemes(List<String> memes) {
        this.memes = memes;
    }
    
    public void init() {
        // Protects us from accidentally re-initialising an object that's retrieved from db
        this.setId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
    }
}
```

Note: We usually access objects by their id which should be unique for all objects in datastore. 

#### Annotating Model Components
##### @Id
```java
    @Id
    private String id;
```

`@Id` is typically the UUID or key, is used for identifying the entry using the key/name,
this is typically not **indexed** and should NOT be modified after creation.

##### @Index
```java
@Index
private String unitCode;
```

The `@Index` annotation is used by datastore to call up, and use for searching and when _Google DataStore_ needs to access the entity/entry. Typically you index most attributes, but there is a **size limit of 1500 bytes** on some, so we suggest you don't index _descriptions_ of different objects, for example the description of a unit would exceed the size limit. (there is also a size limit of 1048487 bytes or 1 MB). 

You can read more about Google DataStore limits [here](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/limits)

##### @SearchIndex
```java
@Index
@SearchIndex
private String unitName;
```

The `@SearchIndex` is a unique annotation, used by the framework to provide searching functionality, which is used by _monPlan Repository_ and can be extended to provide Searching by substrings, substrings are created upon initialisation of the entity.


### Making the Repository
```java
package edu.monash.monplan.repository;

import com.threewks.gaetools.search.gae.SearchConfig;
import edu.monash.monplan.model.David;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public class DavidRepository extends MonPlanRepository<David> {

    public DavidRepository(SearchConfig searchConfig) {
        super(David.class, searchConfig, David.codeField, David.nameField);
    }
}

```
This is all that needs to be done for a repository!

We take care of implementing the following in the superclass `MonPlanRepository` for a generic type `T ` that `extends DataModel`.
In this case since we have a concrete class `David` which `extends DataModel`, we specify this in the angle brackets `<David>` which tells the superclass `MonPlanRepository` to treat all `T`s as `David`s.
This means calling `getAll()` on `DavidRepository` will return a list of `David` objects `List<David>` making all the below methods usable.

The searching is done through `StringRepository` which is part of 3weeks [thunder GAE](https://github.com/3wks/thundr-gae) framework which allows [thunder][https://github.com/3wks/thundr] (a lightweight, web MVC for java designed for cloud platforms) to run in a GAE environment.

```java
public class MonPlanRepository<T extends DataModel> extends StringRepository<T> {
    ...
    
    public List<T> getAll()
    
    public List<T> getAll(int maxCount)
    
    public T getById(String id)
    
    public List<T> getByName(String name) 
    
    public List<T> getByCode(String code)
    
    public T create(T modelInstance)
}
```

    
### Making the Service 

```java
package edu.monash.monplan.service;

import edu.monash.monplan.model.David;
import org.monplan.abstraction_layer.MonPlanRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class DavidService extends MonPlanService<David> {
   
    public DavidService(MonPlanRepository<David> repository) {
        super(repository);
    }
}
```
This is all that needs to be done for a service!

`@Service` is an annotation which is part of Java's Spring framework. It handles the business logic. In our case we implement the following methods in `MonPlanService` making them available to `DavidService`.

```java
public class MonPlanService<T extends DataModel> {
    ...
    
    public List<T> getByCode(String code)
        
    public List<T> getAll()
    
    public List<T> getAll(int maxCount)
    
    public List<T> getByName(String name)
    
    public T getById(String id)
    
    public T create(T modelInstance) throws FailedOperationException
    
    public T create(T modelInstance, boolean allowDuplicateCodes) throws FailedOperationException
    
    public T updateById(T modelInstance) throws InsufficientResourcesException, NotFoundException, FailedOperationException
    
    public T updateById(T modelInstance, boolean allowDuplicateCodes) throws InsufficientResourcesException, NotFoundException, FailedOperationException
    
    public void deleteById(String id) throws NotFoundException, FailedOperationException
}
```

This handles interacting with the data persistence layer.

### Making The Controller
```java
package edu.monash.monplan.controller;

import edu.monash.monplan.model.David;
import org.monplan.abstraction_layer.MonPlanService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/davids/")
public class DavidController extends MonPlanController<David> {

    @Autowired
    public DavidController(MonPlanService<David> service) {
        super(service);
    }

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public ResponseEntity createDavid(@RequestBody David david) {
        return this.create(david);
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity getDavidById(@PathVariable(value="id") String id) {
        return this.getById(id);
    }

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public ResponseEntity getDavidsByParams(@RequestParam(value="code", required=false) String[] codes,
                                           @RequestParam(value="name", required=false) String[] names) {
        return this.getByParams(codes, names);
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
    public ResponseEntity updateDavidById(@PathVariable(value="id") String id,
                                         @RequestBody David David) {
        return this.updateById(id, David);
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
    public ResponseEntity updateDavidById(@PathVariable(value="id") String id) {
        return this.deleteById(id);
    }
}

```
`@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` are part of Java Spring framework.

In `MonPlanController` we implement the following.

```java
public class MonPlanController<T extends DataModel> {
    ...
    
    ResponseEntity create(T modelInstance)
    
    ResponseEntity getById(String id)
    
    ResponseEntity getByParams(String[] codes, String[] names) 
    
    ResponseEntity getByParams(String[] codes, String[] names, Integer itemsPerPage, Integer pageNumber)
    
    ResponseEntity updateById(String id, T modelInstance)
    
    ResponseEntity<ResponseMessage> deleteById(String id)
}
```

`ResponseEntity` is part of Java Spring's framework which is a REST template for HTTP responses.
Since we have these methods we just call them in `DavidController` along with providing the path for the API endpoint and the HTTP methods allowed.

# Building and Deploying a Single Paged Web Application
The framework can also be used to build and deploying a Single paged web application, such SPWAs can include a _production build of a ReactJS_ application.

?> This step is really important as if you are using **Declarative Routing** such as [_react-router_](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)

The steps are to building and deploying a production ReactJS SPWA.
1. Run `yarn build` to build the application
2. Copy static files from `/build` directory into `/src/main/resources/WEBAPP`
3. Delete every **controller**, **service**, **repository** and **model** that you are not using.
4. Create a new class called _WebConfig.java_ in `src/main/java/edu/monash/monplan/config`
5. Edit `WebConfig.java` with the following:

```java
package edu.monash.monplan.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.ViewControllerRegistry;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurerAdapter;

@Configuration
public class WebConfig  {

    @Bean
    public WebMvcConfigurerAdapter forwardToIndex() {
        return new WebMvcConfigurerAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void addViewControllers(ViewControllerRegistry registry) {
                // forward requests to /admin and /user to their index.html
                registry.addViewController("/**").setViewName(
                        "forward:/index.html");
            }
        };
    }
}
```
This will route everything to React-Router, or if you need several routes, just add it to the `ViewControllerRegistry`

You can look at how we did it with our current `development` build [here](https://github.com/MonashUnitPlanner/springboot-spwa-gae-demo)

# Tools
There are several tools bundled up and ready OOB (out-of-the-box) to be deployed.

## Using the Maven Google App Engine CLI

To run and build a localised version of the app run:

```
mvn appengine:devserver
```

To deploy an application to **Google App Engine** execute:

```
mvn appengine:update
```

Sometimes, when you decide to cancel an _update_, you'll need to run:

```
mvn appengine:rollback
```

You should also clean the package after fixing errors
```
mvn clean package
```
## Using Swagger for Documentation
We have included **springfox-swagger2** and **springfox-swagger-ui** as Repos, allowing you to document code automatically.

To access the documentation locally visit: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

When deployed to Google App Engine, your team's frontend developers can use this tool to see and play with how the routes are handled. It is accessible over `https://my-app-name.appspot.com/swagger-ui.html`

### Configuring Swagger

Displaying the page on how Swagger is configured is available as part of `SwaggerConfig.java` which is part of the `edu.monash.monplan.config` environment.

To edit simply change the following section of the `SwaggerConfig.java` class.
```java
    private ApiInfo apiDocInfo() {
        // you can update the configuration here
        ApiInfo apiInfo = new ApiInfo(
                "My REST API", 
                "Some custom description of API.",
                "v2",
                "Terms of service",
                "esol-monplan-ops-l@monash.edu",
                "MIT",
                "https://github.com/lorderikir/springboot-base-gae-java8/blob/master/LICENSE");
        return apiInfo;
    }
```

## Security Tokens
Security Tokens are automatically generated upon load with the username `user`, for example:
``` 
[INFO]
[INFO] Using default security password: 712c1aa7-d7b6-4364-a4ac-a19c5aa47f3d
[INFO]
```

Therefore you can do a HTTP Request with username:password
for example:
```
user:712c1aa7-d7b6-4364-a4ac-a19c5aa47f3d
```


# Tips

## Use RESTful API Principles
Really follow REST API standards, to make it easier for developers to develop on, both frontend and backend, afterall your API should make it easier for everyone to develop one,

You can read more about the standards [here](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api)
